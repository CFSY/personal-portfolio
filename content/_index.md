## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/pic.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

I am a final year Computer Science student at the **National University of Singapore**.  My passion lies in backend engineering with a focus on databases and networks. I am driven by the challenge of building robust and efficient solutions for complex technical problems.

Currently, I am interning with the **TikTok Global Live Streaming Backend** team, developing systems that power live streaming for millions of users. This experience has allowed me to work with cutting-edge technologies and contribute to systems that operate at a **massive scale**.

## Experiences

I have had the privilege of working with exceptional teams across diverse organizations, spanning various business domains and scales.

These experiences have enriched my professional journey and broadened my perspective in the field.

### [TikTok - Backend Engineering Intern](https://developers.tiktok.com/)

Engineered high-performance microservices for tracking live content moderation performance, handling 200,000+ events per second across 1000+ compute instances.

### [Infr AI - Full-Stack Intern](https://infr.ai/)

Revolutionized project workflows by developing a concurrent file export system and a 3D file conversion microservice, significantly reducing processing times and enhancing user experience through server-side automation.

### [Central Provident Fund (CPF) - Java Backend Engineering Intern](https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/who-we-are)

Modernised legacy systems by migrating COBOL scripts to Java Spring Batch, while collaborating with diverse stakeholders to ensure accurate policy implementation and conducting comprehensive testing for optimal reliability.

## Projects

### [CHAD](https://github.com/CFSY/CHAD)

Developed a real-time multiplayer game in Unity with a custom server-client system built from scratch. Directly interfaced with networking protocols like UDP and TCP and improved game performance with memory and I/O optimizations.

### [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://threejs-tictactoe.vercel.app)

Explored 3D on the web with a beautiful rendition of tic-tac-toe powered by three.js and a simple minimax AI.
